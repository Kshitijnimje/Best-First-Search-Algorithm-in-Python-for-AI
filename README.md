# Best-First-Search-Algorithm-in-Python-for-AI
This GitHub repository contains a Python implementation of the Best First Search (BFS) algorithm, a fundamental and widely used artificial intelligence (AI) search algorithm. BFS is known for its ability to efficiently find the most promising paths in search spaces, making it a valuable tool in various AI applications.

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Best First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is a powerful AI search algorithm known for its efficient pathfinding and heuristic optimization capabilities. Use it to find optimal solutions in various AI applications.

## Key Features

- **Greedy Approach**: BFS prioritizes the best paths by exploring nodes with the lowest heuristic values.
- **Heuristic Function**: Incorporates a heuristic function for intelligent path exploration.
- **Python Implementation**: Well-documented Python code for easy integration into your AI projects.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python [Python Version Required]
